        <h1>Travel to <strong class="heading-japan">Japan</strong></h1>
        <h2>Why Japan?</h2>
        <p id="reasons-text">Japan is a popular tourist destination for <em>many reasons:</em></p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li> Local temples and shrines are incredible </li>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Yasukuni_Shrine_201005.jpg" alt="Yasukuni Shrine" width="400">
            <p class="japan-paragraph">Kyoto is the magical, ancient city of Japan known for being the spiritual centre of the country. Immerse yourself in the beauty and stillness of its many temples.</p>
            <li> Japan is the cleanest country in the world </li>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Pedestrian_road_with_pavements_and_paper_umbrellas%2C_Higashiyama-ku%2C_Kyoto%2C_Japan%2C_early_morning.jpg/1200px-Pedestrian_road_with_pavements_and_paper_umbrellas%2C_Higashiyama-ku%2C_Kyoto%2C_Japan%2C_early_morning.jpg" alt="Pedestrian road with pavements and paper umbrellas, Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto, Japan, early morning" width="400">
            <p class="japan-paragraph">Unlike many other countries, cleanliness is ingrained as part of Japan's history, becoming part of its culture since the 12th century, when Zen Buddhism made its path in this culture from China.</p>
            <li> Pristine natural scenery </li>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Saihouji-kokedera01.jpg" alt="The moss garden at the Saihō-ji temple in Kyoto" width="400">
            <p class="japan-paragraph">Japanese Zen-style moss gardens display unique tranquility. The stunning garden of Saiho-ji Temple is a must-see while in Kyoto.</p>
        </ul>
        <p class="japan-paragraph"> Japan is truly timeless, a place where <strong class="ancient-modern">ancient traditions</strong> fuse with <strong class="ancient-modern">modern life</strong>, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. </p>
        <h2 class="heading-japan">Best time to visit Japan</h2>
        <p class="japan-paragraph"> There really is no best or worst time to visit Japan. The timing of your trip all depends on what you want to see and do and how willing you are to share your Japan travel experience with other travellers. </p>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><p class="japan-paragraph"> Across the country <strong class="list">sakura (cherry blossom) season</strong> in Spring is one of the most popular times to visit. But it happens at different times across the country due to the differences in climate from north to south along the island chain.</p></li>
            <li><p class="japan-paragraph"> Another less popular, but no less stunning, time to visit is <strong class="list">Autumn</strong> as the leaves begin to change colour.<br> Whilst this doesn’t quite bring in the crowds like sakura season does, the sheer array of colours on display is absolutely stunning, particularly on Japan’s most northerly island, Hokkaido. </p></li>
            <li><p class="japan-paragraph"> <strong class="list">Summer</strong> brings sweltering temperatures and typhoons in the south. However, Japan is extremely well prepared for such events. As such is still possible to travel to Japan during this of year. </p></li>
            <li><p class="japan-paragraph"> <strong class="list">Winter</strong> brings some of the world’s best skiing on Hokkaido as snow makes some roads and hiking trails impassable. However, this is also the best time to see the famous ice flows close to the Shiretoko National Park. </p></li>
